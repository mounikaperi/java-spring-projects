Methods:

      public final void nap(int minutes) throws InterruptedException {}

      - This is called method declaration. Two parts - method name and parameter list are called the method signature

Access Modifiers:

      - An access modifier determines what classes a method can be accessed from. 
      - Access modifiers help to enforce when these components are allowed to talk to each other
            - private: method can be called only from within the same class
            - package: method can be called only from class in same package. also called as package-private/default access
            - protected: method can be called only from a class in the same package or a subclass
            - public: method can be called anywhere
      - Optional specifiers for methods:
            - static: Indicates that method is a member of the shared class object
            - abstract: Used in an abstract class or interface when the method body is excluded.
            - final: Specifies that the method may not be overriden in a subclass.
            - default: Used in an interface to provide default imlementation of method for classes that implement interface
            - synchronized: Used with multithreaded code
            - native: Used with interacting with code written in another language such as C++
            - strictfp: Used for making floating-point calculations portable

Effectively final variables:

      - An effectively final local variable is one that is not modified after it is assigned. This means that the value of a variable doesnt change after it is et regardless of whether it is explicitly marked as final.

Understanding Inheritance:

      1. Inheritance is a process by which subclass automatically includes certain members of the class, including primitives, objects or methods defined in parent class.
      2. When one class inherits from a parent class, all public and protected members are automatically available as part of child class. Private members are restricted to the class they are defined and are never available via inheritance.

Class Modifiers:

      final: The class may not be extended
      abstract: The class is abstract may contain abstract methods and requires a concrete subclass to instantiate
      sealed: The class may only be extended by a specific list of classes
      non-sealed: A subclass of a sealed class permits potentially unnamed subclasses.
      static: Used for static nested classes defined within a class.

Exception Handling:

      java.lang.Throwable
            -> Error
            -> Exception
                -> All subclasses are called checked exceptions (Compiler will check if these are handled or not)
                -> RuntimeExceptions
                    -> All subclasses are called Unchecked exceptions (Compiler will not check if they are handled)

      try..catch
      throw
      throws

      Why Compiler has two kinds of exceptions? Why checked and unchecked? why compiler doesn't check unchecked exceptions?

      1. Unchecked Exceptions must be avoided through defensive programming but they are not expected to be handled.
      2. Checked Exceptions cannot be avoided, hence it is mandate to handle them.

        Examples:

          public String getValue(int index) {
            return index>=0 && index<myArray.length ? this.myArray[index] : null; // Avoided ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
          }
          public void getSalary(Employee emp, double percent) {
             if (emp != null) {
               emp.setSalary(emp.getSalary() + emp.getSalary() * percent); // Avoided Null Pointer Exception
              }
          }

        Checked Exceptions:
          1. IOException
          2. FileNotFoundException
          3. SQLException

Regular try-catch

        try {
            // statment that may raise an exception
        } catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
            // logic
        } catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
            // logic
        } catch (ExceptionType3 e3) {
            // logic
        } catch (ExceptionType4 e4) {
            // logic
        }

try-with-multi-catch

      try {
            // statment that may raise an exception
      } catch (ExceptionType1 e1 | ExceptionType2 e2 | ExceptionType3 e3) {
            // logic
      } finally {
        // used to close the resources to avoid resource Leakage
      }

try-with-resources

    try (declare closeable objects like steams files or connections) {
            // statment that may raise an exception
    } catch (ExceptionType1 e1 | ExceptionType2 e2 | ExceptionType3 e3) {
            // logic
    }
    // finally block is not needed here
    
        
Interfaces (From JDK 8)

      1. Interfaces can accomodate method with implementation but those methods must be marked as 'default'
            interface Shape() {
                  void area();
                  void perimeter();
                  public default double estimatePaintCost(double paintRate) {
                        return this.area() * paintRate;
                  }
            }
      2. Functional Interfaces: 
            Interfaces that have only one abstract method. To ensure that a interface remains so. @FunctionalInterface compiler check annotation is used.
            Functional Interfaces are introduced to facilitate a new programming paradigm called functional programming.
            Functional Programming is passing a function as a parameter to another function.
            Functional Interfaces can be implemented using Lambda Expressions without having to create a subclass.

            @FunctionalInterface
            interface Give {
                  String doGive();
            }
            public class MyApplication {
                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                        Give orgName = () => "Cognizant";
                        System.out.println(orgName.doGive());
                        
                        Give greet = () => "Hello"; // Lambda Expression
                        System.out.println(greet.doGive());

                        Give greetByTime = () => {
                              String greeting = "";
                              int h = LocalTime.now().getHour();
                              if (h >=3 && h<=11) 
                                    greeting = "Good Morning";
                              else if (h >= 12 && h<=15) 
                                    greeting = "Good Noon";
                              else
                                    greeting = "Good Evening";
                              return greeting;
                        };
                        System.out.println(greetbyTime.doGive());
                  }
            }
      3. Types of Functional Interfaces:
            - Consumer
            - Supplier
            - Predicate
            - Operator

            Consumer: 
                  Functional Interfaces whose abstract method that accepts a param but doesnt return any value is called a Consumer
            Supplier:
                  Functional Interfaces whose abstract method doesn't accepts any param but returns a value is called Supplier
            Predicate:
                  Functional Interface whose abstract method always returns a boolean value. It doesnt matter whether it accepts a param or not, return value is always 
                  boolean.
            Operator:
                  Functional Interface whose absract method accepts param and also returns a value.

      4. java.util.function package offers a lot of pre-created functional interfaces
      5. A functional interface can refer to a method, as long as the signature of the method being referred matched with the signature of the functional interface.
      6. Scope resolution operator :: means referred -> System.out::println

Generics

      1. Generics are used to create Abstract Data Types (ADT's)
      2. ADTs are used to house algorithms that are independent of the data types
      3. For Example: Sorting, Searching, Comparisions, swapping etc are logics that wont change with data type of the data
      4. Generics do not support primitive data types and we have to use Wrapper classes in such cases.

Collections

      1 Java approach for data structures
      2. java.util.* has
                  1-> Collection (I) -> represents a collection of data
                                    -> Methods:
                                          -> add(element)
                                          -> remove(element)
                                          -> contains(element)
                                          -> size()
                                          -> stream()
                        1.a-> List (I) -> represents a linear data structure
                                    -> Allows index on elements and hence support index based operations like 
                                          -> add (element, index)
                                          -> remove(element, index)
                                          -> get(element, index) ...
                                    -> Allows duplicate elements to be added and more than one null elements
                                    -> classes that implement List Interface are:
                                          -> ArrayList -> Growable array
                                          -> Vector    -> Synchronized Growable array
                                          -> LinkedList -> Doubly linked list
                        1.b-> Set (I)  -> represents a non linear data structure and no duplicates are allowed. Index based operations are not possible
                                       -> Classes implementing Set interface are:
                                             -> HashSet -> pure set implementation. It follows no order of retrieval.
                                             -> LinkedHashSet -> It follows entry order for retrieval
                              1.b.a -> SortedSet (I)
                                             -> Classes implementing SortedSet interface are:
                                             -> TreeSet -> It follows sorted order for retrieval
                              
                  2-> Map (I)  -> represents a collection of key:value pairs, duplicate keys are not allowed.
                               -> Methods 
                                     -> put(key, value)
                                     -> keySet(),
                                     -> Values(),
                                     -> containsKey(),
                                     -> size(),
                                     -> set (key, value)
                              -> Classes implementing Map interface are:
                                    -> HashMap -> . It follows no order of retrieval.
                                    -> LinkedHashSet -> It follows entry order for retrieval
                        -> SortedMap (I)
                              -> Classes implementing SortedMap interface are:
                                    -> TreeMap -> It follows sorted order for retrieval, sorted based on keys
                  3-> Collections (C) -> Collections class offers a lot of utility methods for a variety of collection related operations.
                  4-> Comparator (I) 
                        -> is a functional interface having "int compare(T a, T b)" as the method.
                        -> It is to be implemented to dictate on how to compare our custom types like Employee, Consumer etc
                        -> The expectation is:
                              -> compare(a, b) -> shall return 0 if a is equal to b
                              -> compare(a, b) -> shall return a negative int if a is less than b
                              -> compare(a, b) -> shall return a positive int if a is greater than b
                        -> java.lang.Comparable interface with method "int compareTo(x)" is also a similar interface
                        -> Comparable is expected to be implemented by the class whose objects must be compared. 
                        -> In that case, the current object is compared within the incoming object
                              a.compareTo(b) -> shall return 0 if a is equal to b
                              a.compareTo(b) -> shall return a negative int if a is less than b
                              a.compareTo(b) -> shall return a positive int if a is greater than b

                        -> Comparable is used as a default comparision logic
                        -> Comparator is used as customized comparision logic

                  between (startDate, endDate)
            Duration
                  between (startTime, endTime)


Streams API

      A stream is a flow of data
      Source <----------------stream------------------> Destination
      Source and destination can be an array or any other collection (lists, sets etc)
      We can operate on the data before the data flows into the destination
      Source 
            <--------------stream---------------------->
                  OPERATION
                        <--------------------stream --------------------------->
                              DESTINATION
      java.util.stream.Stream class represents the stream
      A stream can be created by using 
            Stream s1 = Stream.of(anArray);
            Stream s2 = list.stream();
            Stream s3 = list.stream();
      Instance methods of Stream are:
            forEach   -> takes a consumer as a param and executes the consumer on each element of the stream and returns nothing 
                        as it doesn't return anything we cannot chain other operations and hence called as TERMINAL
            reduce    -> reduce takes a binaryOperator and executes the binaryOperator on each pair of values and returns a single value wrapped in java.util.Optional class
                         int[] arr = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
                         Optional<Integer> result = Stream.of(arr).reduce((x, y) -> x+y);
                         result.get() will give 10
                         Optional is to avoid nullpointerexceptions

                     -> takes a identity value and a binaryOperator and execute the binaryOperator on each pair of values and returns a single value
                        int[] arr = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
                        Integer result = Stream.of(arr).reduce(0, (x,y) -> x + y); // result is 10
                        Integer result2 = Stream.of(arr).reduce(Integer.MIN_VALUE, (x,y) -> x>y ? x : y); // result is 4
                        As it doesn't return a stream, we cannot chain other operations and hence is called a TERMINAL
            collect  -> accepts a Collector object and returns a collection. 
                        Collectors.toList()
                        Collectors.toSet() are the prebuilt objects of the Collector
                        int[] arr = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};
                        List<Integer> list = Stream.of(arr).collect(Collectors.toList());
                        As it doesn't return a stream, we cannot chain other operations and hence is called a TERMINAL
            filter   -> takes a predicate and returns a new stream containing values that satisfy the predicate. 
                        As it returns new stream, operations can be chained and hence called INTERMEDIATE.
                        int[] arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
                        Stream.of(arr).filter(x -> x%2 == 0).reduce(0, (x,y) -> x + y); // returns result as 6
            map      -> takes a mapper and returns a new stream containing all mapped values from old stream.
                        int[] arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
                        Stream.of(arr).map(n -> n*n).forEach(System.out::println); // prints [1, 4, 9, 16]
